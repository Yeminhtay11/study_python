- Introduction to Python
  
   Installation library,dynamic typing, and data types: 1. Integers, floats,str, boolean,list
Control structures (if, elif, else, for, while), functions defining and calling parameters and arguments, return, default parameter and keyword argument, Lambda function and modules. #write a function to check if a number is prime or find all prime number
Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. List methods: append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), index(), count(), sort(), reverse(), etc.Tuple methods: index(), count().Dictionary methods: keys(), values(), items(), get(), update(), pop(), popitem().Set methods: add(), remove(), discard(), clear()File handling, error handling, and introduction to object-oriented programming. Opening and closing files using open().Reading from files: read(), readline(), readlines().Writing to files: write(), writelines(). #do word count in file Error handling, try, except, else, and finally blocks for handling exceptions.
Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance). The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

   An object consists of:
   State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
   Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
   Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
   To understand the state, behavior, and identity let us take the example of the class dog (explained above). 
   The identity can be considered as the name of the dog.
   State or Attributes can be considered as the breed, age, or color of the dog.
   The behavior can be considered as to whether the dog is eating or sleeping.
   The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your objec
