## RADAR : imaging and non imaging radar
 SAR is imaging radar

 used microwave range of elctromagnetic spectrum

 reflected  is backscattering

 it is two dimenionsal data of the surface : phase(rad) and amplitude(db)
## Radar parameter and Surface Parameter
### Parameter that infulence to the Radar
- Wavelength, it is primary factor for penerattion.
- polarization HH,HV,VH(croos polarized),VV(copolarized) =quard pole  and HH more penerate than VV
- Incidence Angle : angle between the direction of the illumination of the radar bd Eath's surface plane, large angle will penerate to surface roughness and wil penerate less into medium. Within the same image, closer to the sensor incidence angle have more uniform than far. Need to consider for classififcation.
    - roughness and smoothness, high intensity mean rough images=>Smooth Surface(black), Rough Surface, Rougher Surface, Volume scattering(within canopy) and Double Bounce
### Surface Parameter
- structure: size relative to wavelength (rough and smooth), size and orientation( ineteract polarized on Vertical and Horizontal) , density(strength) - saturation problem occur
  [Size reative to Wavelength](https://youtu.be/KitbOq7ARNQ)
- dielectric constant(moisture content of land surface)

### Geometic Distortion
- layover and forshotening
- shawdow using interpolation
- speclkle 
-forest is type of volume scattering and it is
